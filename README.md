# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React Component

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS with React.  The issue involves utility classes not applying correctly to a component, even when the classes are valid and correctly implemented. The root cause and solution are explained below.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` uses standard Tailwind classes (`flex`, `justify-center`, `items-center`, `bg-blue-500`, etc.).  However, these styles are not rendered in the browser despite importing Tailwind in the main App.js file. This behaviour is irregular, as other projects working with the same version of Tailwind and similar setup function correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the correct import of Tailwind CSS and that it's correctly configured to work with your React project. The problem was a failure to properly configure or import Tailwind CSS within the application which resulted in the inability to properly render the classes.
